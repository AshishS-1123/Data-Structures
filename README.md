# Data Structures In C Plus Plus

In this project, different types of **Data Structures** have been implemented, using **C++**. 
This project has been made for educational purpose only, thinking that it might help my *Competitive Programming* Skills.
For each of the Data Structure Implemented, a variety of functions have been added to interact with it.

For example, in case of **Linked List**, some of the methods offered are 
- **Insert Element**
- **Delete Element**
- **Reverse List**
- **Search**

Also, I have tried to implement different *Variations of these Data Structures*.
For example, for **Linked List**-
- **Singly Linked List**
- **Doubly Linked List**
- **Circular Linked List**
- **Doubly Circular Linked List**
